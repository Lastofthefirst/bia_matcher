But what is intended in the divine Tablets is that the reality of the divine Essence is sanctified above all understanding, exalted beyond all imagination.  For whatsoever man may imagine is encompassed by him, and that which encompasses is without a doubt greater than that which is encompassed.  It is therefore clear that what is imagined is the creation, not the Creator.  For the reality of Divinity is sanctified above all human fancy.  In this day all people are worshippers of idle fancies, for they conceive a god in the realm of imagination and worship him.  Thus if you were to ask someone who is engaged in prayer:  “Whom are you worshipping?” he would say:  “God.”  “What God?”  “God as I imagine Him.”  Whereas that which is in his imagination is not God.  All people are therefore worshippers of their own thoughts and fancies.",

For, as already mentioned, the reality of Divinity is transcendent, sanctified, and beyond all imagination.  All that can be imagined are the holy and divine Manifestations.  There is nowhere else for man to direct his gaze, and should he pass beyond this he will fall prey to delusion.  Thus what is meant by the words “He is God” is that that manifest Being is the promised Beauty and the Day-Star of Truth, the Exponent of the secrets of Lordship and Divinity, the Repository of the mysteries of the All-Merciful, and the Source of the signs of His Singleness; and that I have begun my discourse with His blessed Name.",

Among them is this:  that, in the days when He Who is the Dayspring of the Sun of Truth engages, through divine inspiration, in revealing the verses of God, in establishing His religion, and in setting forth His teachings, He is so enraptured and enkindled as to find no time for food or drink.  For example, when Moses went up to Mount Sinai to establish the religion of God, He fasted for forty days; and fasting was therefore enjoined upon the Israelites to awaken and admonish them.  Likewise Christ, at the beginning of the foundation of His divine religion, the establishment of His teachings, and the formulation of His admonitions, disregarded for forty days all physical necessities and refrained from food and drink.  The Apostles and early Christian believers also fasted, but this fast was changed by the Church Councils to abstinence from certain foods.  Similarly, the Qur’án was revealed during the month of Ramaḍán\n                                4\n                             and therefore the fast was enjoined during that period.  In the same way, in the beginning of His manifestation, the Báb would be so overcome with emotion at the revelation of the divine verses that for days He would confine himself to drinking tea.  Likewise, in the days when He was instituting the divine teachings, and when the divine verses would be sent down continuously, Bahá’u’lláh would be so overwhelmed with the intensity of their influence and the emotions surging within His heart that He would take but little food.",

As history records, the Christians would in the early days observe a complete fast.  For every sincere soul who has a beloved aspires to whatever condition his beloved is experiencing:  If the beloved were sad he would wish for sorrow, and if joyous he would aspire to joy; if the beloved were at ease he would seek comfort, and if troubled he would desire the same.  Now, since in those days the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh would abstain from food and drink, or would partake of only the least amount, it became incumbent upon Their loved ones to follow Their example.  Even as it is said in the Tablet of Visitation:  “... who, for love of Thee, have observed all whereunto they were bidden”.\n                                5\n                             This is but one of the wisdoms of fasting.",

The material fast consists in abstaining from food and drink, that is, refraining from satisfying the physical appetites.  But the true and spiritual fast is for man to forsake covetous desires, heedlessness, and evil and animalistic attributes.  The material fast is therefore a symbol of that spiritual fast.  It is like saying:  “O Divine Providence!  As I am abstaining from bodily desires and from all occupation with food and drink, even so purify and sanctify my heart from the love of anyone save Thyself, and shield and protect my soul from corrupt inclinations and satanic qualities, that my spirit may commune with the breaths of holiness and fast from the mention of all else besides Thee.”",

It will never come to pass.”  Even more, they called it sheer ignorance and counted themselves among the exponents of reason and understanding.  But before long it became clear that what Abraham had proclaimed was indeed the truth, and that it was their own thoughts that were the idle fancies.  For after a short time the teachings of Abraham were realized in the world:  The Holy Land was given to His descendants; the foundations of the religion of God were established; Isaac and Jacob came into the world; Joseph became ruler in Egypt; Ishmael was blessed and illumined Mount Paran; Moses the Interlocutor appeared, beheld in the desert of Sinai the blazing fire of God in the Burning Bush, rescued the Israelites from their oppression and captivity at the hands of the Egyptians, led them to the Holy Land, and, through His teachings and His religion, which were consonant with the needs of the age, founded a mighty nation.  Thus did the deniers fully experience their error, yet they were not chastened or admonished.",

But after a short time it became clear and evident that what Moses had proclaimed was indeed the truth and had come to pass, that the religion of God had been put into full effect and had secured the honour and advancement of all Israel, and that it was the thoughts and imaginations of the Egyptians that were the idle fancies.  This was the second experience and yet the people were still not admonished and awakened, but rather persisted in their ignorance until Jesus appeared with a beauteous countenance and an eloquent tongue, and spread abroad the sweet savours of the rose-garden of divine mysteries and imparted the grace of the Holy Spirit.",

Thus it progresses further and assumes a higher reality than that which it initially possessed.  This indeed is the means of progress and renewal from the mineral to the vegetable, from the vegetable to the animal, and from the animal to the human world.  For as plants grow they are eaten by the animal and replace those elements which have been depleted in the latter’s body.  In this manner the plants enter the animal kingdom.  The microscopic organisms in the air, water, and food enter in turn the body of man and replace that which has been assimilated therein.",
