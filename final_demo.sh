# Show the key enhancements
echo "Key Enhancements in the Document Matching System:"
echo "--------------------------------------------------"
echo "1. Multi-dimensional Similarity Metrics:"
echo "   - Semantic similarity (from embeddings)"
echo "   - Length similarity (structural feature)"
echo "   - Word count similarity (structural feature)"
echo
echo "2. Composite Scoring Approach:"
echo "   - Formula: Composite = (0.7 × Semantic) + (0.15 × Length) + (0.15 × Word)"
echo "   - Provides better discrimination between correct and incorrect matches"
echo
echo "3. Filename Similarity Enhancement:"
echo "   - Normalizes filenames (replaces - and _ with spaces)"
echo "   - Computes Jaccard similarity between filename word sets"
echo "   - Used as secondary factor in document ranking"
echo
echo "4. Max Pooling for Robust Matching:"
echo "   - Focuses on strongest matches while ignoring noise"
echo "   - Computes average of maximum similarity scores"

# Show how to build and run
echo "How to Build and Run the Enhanced System:"
echo "------------------------------------------"
echo "1. Build the system:"
echo "   cargo build --release"
echo
echo "2. Run the enhanced matching process:"
echo "   ./target/release/matching \\"
echo "     --model-path nomic-embed-text-v2-moe.f16.gguf \\"
echo "     --xml-documents-dir xml_json_inputs \\"
echo "     --pdf-input-dir pdf_source_inputs \\"
echo "     --output-dir output \\"
echo "     --similarity-threshold 0.01 \\"
echo "     --top-k-matches 3"

# Show sample output explanation
echo "Sample Output Explanation:"
echo "--------------------------"
echo "The enhanced system generates JSON output files with:"
echo "1. Enhanced document-level similarity scores using composite metrics"
echo "2. Paragraph-level matches with improved accuracy"
echo "3. Filename similarity information as secondary factor"
echo "4. Statistics showing matches above different thresholds"
