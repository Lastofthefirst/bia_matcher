In the first Gospel according to Matthew it is recorded: And when\n                     they asked Jesus concerning the signs of His coming, He said unto them:\n                     “Immediately after the oppression\n                        19\n                     \n                     of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,\n                     and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the earth shall be\n                     shaken: and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then\n                     shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man\n                     coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And he shall send\n                     his angels with a great sound of a trumpet.”\n                        20\n                     \n                     Rendered into the Persian tongue,\n                        21\n                     \n                     the purport of these words is as follows: When the oppression and afflictions\n                     that are to befall mankind will have come to pass, then shall the sun be\n                     withheld from shining, the moon from giving light, the stars of heaven shall\n                     fall upon the earth, and the pillars of the earth shall quake. At that time,\n                     the signs of the Son of man shall appear in heaven, that is, the promised\n                     Beauty and Substance of life shall, when these signs have appeared, step forth\n                     out of the realm of the invisible into the visible world.

In the first Gospel according to Matthew it is recorded: And when\n                     they asked Jesus concerning the signs of His coming, He said unto them:\n                     “Immediately after the oppression<sup class=\"brl-note brl-footnote\">\n                        <a id=\"footnote-ki_en-19-ref\" href=\"#footnote-ki_en-19-text\">19</a>\n                     </sup>\n                     of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,\n                     and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the earth shall be\n                     shaken: and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then\n                     shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man\n                     coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And he shall send\n                     his angels with a great sound of a trumpet.”<sup class=\"brl-note brl-footnote\">\n                        <a id=\"footnote-ki_en-20-ref\" href=\"#footnote-ki_en-20-text\">20</a>\n                     </sup>\n                     Rendered into the Persian tongue,<sup class=\"brl-note brl-footnote\">\n                        <a id=\"footnote-ki_en-21-ref\" href=\"#footnote-ki_en-21-text\">21</a>\n                     </sup>\n                     the purport of these words is as follows: When the oppression and afflictions\n                     that are to befall mankind will have come to pass, then shall the sun be\n                     withheld from shining, the moon from giving light, the stars of heaven shall\n                     fall upon the earth, and the pillars of the earth shall quake. At that time,\n                     the signs of the Son of man shall appear in heaven, that is, the promised\n                     Beauty and Substance of life shall, when these signs have appeared, step forth\n                     out of the realm of the invisible into the visible world. And He saith: at that\n                     time, all the peoples and kindreds that dwell on earth shall bewail and lament,\n                     and they shall see that divine Beauty coming from heaven, riding upon the\n                     clouds with power, grandeur, and magnificence, sending His angels with a great\n                     sound of a trumpet. Similarly, in the three other Gospels, according to Luke,\n                     Mark, and John, the same statements are recorded.

When\n                     Moses came unto Pharaoh and delivered unto him, as bidden by God, the divine\n                     Message, Pharaoh spoke insultingly saying: “Art thou not he that committed\n                     murder, and became an infidel?” Thus recounted the Lord of majesty as having\n                     been said by Pharaoh unto Moses: “What a deed is that which Thou hast done!\n                     Thou art one of the ungrateful. He said: ‘I did it indeed, and I was one of\n                     those who erred. And I fled from you when I feared you, but My Lord hath given\n                     Me wisdom, and hath made Me one of His Apostles.’”<sup class=\"brl-note brl-footnote\">\n                        <a id=\"footnote-ki_en-45-ref\" href=\"#footnote-ki_en-45-text\">45</a>\n                     </sup>"

All the signs and\n                     allusions concerning the Day of Judgment, which thou hast heard, such as the\n                     raising of the dead, the Day of Reckoning, the Last Judgment, and others have\n                     been made manifest through the revelation of that verse.

Hast thou not heard\n                     how with one single verse He hath sundered light from darkness, the righteous\n                     from the ungodly, and the believing from the infidel? All the signs and\n                     allusions concerning the Day of Judgment, which thou hast heard, such as the\n                     raising of the dead, the Day of Reckoning, the Last Judgment, and others have\n                     been made manifest through the revelation of that verse. These revealed words\n                     were a blessing to the righteous who on hearing them exclaimed: “O God our\n                     Lord, we have heard, and obeyed.” They were a curse to the people of iniquity\n                     who, on hearing them, affirmed: “We have heard and rebelled.” Those words,\n                     sharp as the sword of God, have separated the faithful from the infidel, and\n                     severed father from son.

Thus\n                     God hath reaffirmed the law of the day of His Revelation, and inscribed it with\n                     the pen of power upon the mystic Tablet hidden beneath the veil of celestial\n                     glory. Wert thou to heed these words, wert thou to ponder their outward and\n                     inner meaning in thy heart, thou wouldst seize the significance of all the\n                     abstruse problems which, in this day, have become insuperable barriers between\n                     men and the knowledge of the Day of Judgment. Then wilt thou have no more\n                     questions to perplex thee. We fain would hope that, God willing, thou wilt not\n                     return, deprived and still athirst, from the shores of the ocean of divine\n                     mercy, nor come back destitute from the imperishable Sanctuary of thy heart’s\n                     desire. Let it now be seen what thy search and endeavors will achieve."

They\n                     have offered, and will continue to offer up their lives, their substance, their\n                     souls, their spirit, their all, in the path of the Well-Beloved. By them, no\n                     station, however exalted, could be more dearly cherished. For lovers have no\n                     desire but the good-pleasure of their Beloved, and have no aim except reunion\n                     with Him."

Most of the verses of the\n                     Qur’án indicate, and bear witness to, this spiritual theme.

Now, if by “attainment unto the Presence of God” is\n                     meant attainment unto the knowledge of such revelation, it is evident that all\n                     men have already attained unto the presence of the unchangeable Countenance of\n                     that peerless King.

Behold how within all things the portals of the Riḍván\n                     of God are opened, that seekers may attain the cities of understanding and\n                     wisdom, and enter the gardens of knowledge and power. Within every garden they\n                     will behold the mystic bride of inner meaning enshrined within the chambers of\n                     utterance in the utmost grace and fullest adornment. Most of the verses of the\n                     Qur’án indicate, and bear witness to, this spiritual theme. The verse: “Neither\n                     is there aught which doth not celebrate His praise”<sup class=\"brl-note brl-footnote\">\n                        <a id=\"footnote-ki_en-106-ref\" href=\"#footnote-ki_en-106-text\">106</a>\n                     </sup>\n                     is eloquent testimony thereto; and “We noted all things and wrote them down,”<sup class=\"brl-note brl-footnote\">\n                        <a id=\"footnote-ki_en-107-ref\" href=\"#footnote-ki_en-107-text\">107</a>\n                     </sup>\n                     a faithful witness thereof. Now, if by “attainment unto the Presence of God” is\n                     meant attainment unto the knowledge of such revelation, it is evident that all\n                     men have already attained unto the presence of the unchangeable Countenance of\n                     that peerless King. Why, then, restrict such revelation to the Day of\n                     Resurrection?"

How well and true is the\n                     saying: “Flingest thou thy calumnies unto the face of Them Whom the one true\n                     God hath made the Trustees of the treasures of His seventh sphere?” Not one\n                     understanding heart or mind, not one among the wise and learned, hath taken\n                     notice of these preposterous statements. And yet, how clear and evident it is\n                     to every discerning heart that this so-called learning is and hath ever been\n                     rejected by Him Who is the one true God. How can the knowledge of these\n                     sciences, which are so contemptible in the eyes of the truly learned, be\n                     regarded as essential to the apprehension of the mysteries of the “Mi‘ráj,”\n                     whilst the Lord of the “Mi‘ráj” Himself was never burdened with a single letter\n                     of these limited and obscure learnings, and never defiled His radiant heart\n                     with any of these fanciful illusions? How truly hath he said: “All human\n                     attainment moveth upon a lame ass, whilst Truth, riding upon the wind, darteth\n                     across space.” By the righteousness of God! Whoso desireth to fathom the\n                     mystery of this “Mi‘ráj,” and craveth a drop from this ocean, if the mirror of\n                     his heart be already obscured by the dust of these learnings, he must needs\n                     cleanse and purify it ere the light of this mystery can be reflected therein."

He must purge his breast, which is the sanctuary of the\n                     abiding love of the Beloved, of every defilement, and sanctify his soul from\n                     all that pertaineth to water and clay, from all shadowy and ephemeral\n                     attachments. He must so cleanse his heart that no remnant of either love or\n                     hate may linger therein, lest that love blindly incline him to error, or that\n                     hate repel him away from the truth.

That\n                     seeker must at all times put his trust in God, must renounce the peoples of the\n                     earth, detach himself from the world of dust, and cleave unto Him Who is the\n                     Lord of Lords.
